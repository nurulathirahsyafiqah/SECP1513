The Clarity Techworks talk gave me a glimpse into ICT jobs in Fintech, particularly roles like Junior Android Developer and UI/UX Designer. 
It made me realize the shift from theoretical study life to practical work life, highlighting the importance of skills like programming and continuous learning. 
The speakers encouraged making wise career choices, teamwork, and creating a professional portfolio. 
Personally, it reinforced the idea that success in the dynamic ICT field requires adaptability and a commitment to ongoing learning.
