Creating a low-fidelity prototype for a cat food dispenser was a practical and insightful experience. 
It offered a cost-effective way to visualize basic design elements, identify potential issues early on, and gather valuable feedback. 
Collaborating with the team enhanced communication and creativity, leading to iterative improvements in the prototype's design and usability. 
Overall, the process significantly contributed to refining our cat food dispenser concept.
